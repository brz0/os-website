The prompt builder tool is made in Notion and can be duplicated into any other Notion account to be used. It uses the database (table) setup with a bunch of pre-set variables to easily allow the user to create a detailed prompt that can be used in Midjourney (or other generative AI tools).

-----

The user gives an initial prompt (the title of the entry), then simply can go through the fields (with descriptions) to add related variables. The variables include art style, scene settings, post-processing, and also has support for midjourney parameters (like aspect ratio).
