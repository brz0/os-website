I'm surprised there isnt more out there focused on an optimized web homepage/new tab experience. It's the first thing you look at when you fire up a browser. I remember about 6 months ago looking desperately for something like this. Something personalized. Theres a few cool browser plugins, but in the end, classic developer solution, I felt like I needed to roll my own setup.

The main goal is to give a quick overview, nothing too detailed. While also being useful as a new tab (hence the google search). The current browsers choose to use things like "Recent Tabs" in the new tab/homepage, which I find just clutters up the space. The goal is also to create a dashboard that a user can easily configure & deploy for themselves.

## Detailed Features

&nbsp;&nbsp;
-----

- A news feed taking a custom array of keywords as topics, uses <Plink href="https://newsapi.org" text="News API" />
- Google search integrated, same google search as always
- 8 Customized bookmarks, which use Google favicon API to grab the icons
- Time and calendar is displayed from config, uses <Plink href="https://momentjs.com" text="MomentJS" />
- Weather data is displayed from config, uses <Plink href="https://openweathermap.org/api" text="Open Weather API" />

The news and weather APIs are free services with rate limits on the amount of times you can hit the API per day/hour. But you shouldn't hit this limit with a free API key, it's mostly put in place to prevent it being used in a production application.

## How to Use

&nbsp;&nbsp;
-----

1. Clone the project

2. Get your API Keys (News API, Open Weather API)

3. Add your info to the config file (weather, location, bookmarks & news keywords)

4. Run command in readme to launch app on computer startup (best way to work with the free News API restrictions)

5. Save the link as a homepage in your browser
