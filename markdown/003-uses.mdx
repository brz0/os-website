I like the idea of a uses page, and the trend of it being standardized on tech builders websites at `/users` for a quick overview. It's good to keep a list of everything in one place, for example if I break something and need to replace it. The items listed have varying levels of enthusiasm (might be a good data point in the future). I've decided to populate it as a table, which allows for an easy overview with filtering. The table is nice because it can be sorted, filtered, and easily linked to the product.

Regarding productivity software I think too often I switch trying to find the optimal stack. Is it notion + trello, or clickup, or apple notes and calendar, or maybe just excel with automations. Nothing is perfect but right now I'm keeping it pretty simple with mostly google apps for main productivity items. They allow for the best cross platform, and the calendar+tasks functionality works well when scheduling day-to-day items.

Currently it only contains hardware, and tooling software (no building/tech stuff) and may stay that way. Software changes often, but I'm trying to stick to a good system and use it in-depth before making any big changes. Simple setup, but easy entry and a good overview.
