The oddscenes VSCode theme is a theme created for high contrast colors, on dark mode. It can be installed via the link below, or directly in VSCode, which connects to the VSCode extension marketplace. It styles every part of the VSCode UI including the syntax, explorer, terminal and all pop-ups.

The goal of this theme was to create a VSCode theme that was using dark mode, had high contrast and used colors that I think make sense/look good. Theres some good neon style extensions out there already but none of them matched the style that I wanted, so I made this template to solve this. The color seperation between everything helps to easily discern all UI elements and code parts, while looking good.
